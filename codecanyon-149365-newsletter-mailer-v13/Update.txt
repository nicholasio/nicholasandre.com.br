Update
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Backup DB

2)Unzip NewsletterMailer.zip

3)Remove the folder app/config from the update (if you would upload this folder your 
db configuration would get lost!) 

4)If you have made any modifications in the .htaccess files (1and1 and GoDaddy users) remove these files from the update before uploading it.

5)Merge the new app folder(without the app/config folder) with the app folder on the server 

6)Update the folder cake on the server (IMPORTANT)
